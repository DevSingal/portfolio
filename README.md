## What have i done in this project?

I have created my portfolio website using React.js which includes my projects that i have completed in past. I have mainly used SASS for styling my website and used Email.js for client to send me emails. I did not used nodemailer.js beacuase then i would have to make backend and all and found this an easy alternative.

to run the website run the following commands in your device:

1. downlaod all the files in your device
2. Go in the folder "Portfolio" and open the terminal
3. run the command "npm install"
4. after all the dependencies are installed run "npm run dev";
