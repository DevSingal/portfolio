                I started watching anime back in 10th class and had Naruto as my first anime (that i hell of an anime) but my main anime watching time was in the lockdown in online classes. I just used binge watch any and every anime i could find. I have watched over 70+ animes and my favourite anime is "Blue Lock" and "Summertime Rendering". I have watched all the mainstream anime and some of the underrated ones too. here is a list of all the animes that i have watched:
